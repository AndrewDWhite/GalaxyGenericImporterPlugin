# GalaxyGenericImporterPlugin
Plugin for GOG Galaxy to allow the generic definition of files to add using regular expressions

Will need both the standard gog plugin https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-integrations-python-api and utils https://github.com/tylerbrawl/Galaxy-Utils packages to be placed as dependencies


Configuration for execution, selection and location of files is located in the emulators.json file.
